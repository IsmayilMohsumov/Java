 Because Morten knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
 Mortenâ€™s smartwatch records the total number of hours spent on cycling each day, for the last 7 days.

 As his best friend, youâ€™ve been asked to write a program that shows how many liters of water Morten should have drunk. The program should accept
 an array of 7 consecutive daily measurements, representing actual hours spent on cycling for the last 7 days.
 As a result, the program should return rounded to the smallest value, number of litres.

 For example:
 3 hours of cycling for last 7 days -> 1 liter
 6.7 hours of cycling for last 7 days -> 3 litres
 11.8 hours of cycling for last 7 days -> 5 litres
